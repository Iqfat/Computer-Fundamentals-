        <p>The dataset is loosely based on the shopping details for customers of a few cities. The values vary profoundly which makes it simple and basic to reproduce any kind of visualization based on it. The data has been populated randomly and holds no relation to any real systems data or confidential data. It is particularly useful for those new to data analysis, providing a basic dataset to build simple models and visualizations using tools like Python or Power BI.</p>
        <p>This dataset includes 2 files: one contains the entire data for customer shopping while the other file has indexed data based on a matrix according to the cities.</p>
